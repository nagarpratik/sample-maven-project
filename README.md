TODO: I will be a good citizen and set description later!


springboot-parent POM (groupId: com.sf.sc.pint) is the only dependency which will need to be updated depending on needs. Please refer to NEXUS to see what the latest version is and update accordingly.

TODO
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

TODO
Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project running

TODO
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.


Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
